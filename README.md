## USING STARTHELPER.BAT FOR UPDATES
`StartHelper.bat` is equipped with a few different tools one of the best is **Updating AutoGo's JSON files**.  
Now this tool doesn't automatically grab the updates from this site. You need to do that yourself.  
And this tool doesn't update the .exe files, you need to replace those yourself as well. 
  
However if you see `commands.json` or `config.json` and even `responses.json` being updated from your version  
You can download those files and store them in `System/updates` folder. From there run `StartHelper.bat` Type 1 and hit enter.  
This will update your old files with any new information without you needing to re-edit these files everytime i add something new.  
The helper plugin will do all that for you. And format it to look nice! (he may re-order things as he sees fit)  

## OUR NEW WIKI
I am updating the wiki to show you even more amazing things you can do with AutoGo  
And the helper plugin!
